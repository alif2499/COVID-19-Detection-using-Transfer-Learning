# COVID-19-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning
In this notebook, the COVID-19 detection is performed using the [COVID-19 Chest X-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/bachrr/covid-chest-xray) Image Dataset. The dataset contains chest X-ray images of normal and COVID-19 affected patients. Here, a convolutional neural network is adopted to extract features and classify images as normal and COVID-19 affected.
